# POWER-BI-

**Power BI** is a Data Visualization and Business Intelligence tool that converts data from different data sources to interactive dashboards and BI reports. Power BI suite provides multiple software, connector, and services - Power BI desktop, Power BI service based on Saas, and mobile Power BI apps available for different platforms. These set of services are used by business users to consume data and build BI reports.

Power BI desktop app is used to create reports, while Power BI Services (Software as a Service - SaaS) is used to publish the reports, and Power BI mobile app is used to view the reports and dashboards.

Power BI Desktop is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. To download the latest version, you can use the following link:

**The parts of Power BI**
Power BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:

1. A Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.
2. An online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service.
3. Power BI mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.

These three elements—Power BI Desktop, the service, and the mobile apps—are designed to let you create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves you and your role most effectively.

Beyond those three, Power BI also features two other elements:

Power BI Report Builder, for creating paginated reports to share in the Power BI service. Read more about paginated reports later in this article.
Power BI Report Server, an on-premises report server where you can publish your Power BI reports, after creating them in Power BI Desktop. Read more about Power BI Report Server later in this article.

**1. COLUMN CHART**

A column chart is a data visualization where each category is represented by a rectangle, with the height of the rectangle being proportional to the values being plotted. Column charts are also known as vertical bar charts.

In the example below, the height of each bar is proportional to the percentage of people who listed each type of cola as being their favorite.

**Required data**

This visualization typically displays categories along the horizontal axis and values along the vertical axis. The chart above plots the data that is shown in the table below.

**Advantages**

They are particularly useful when:

1. **The data has a small number of discrete categories, with a single value for each category.** Where there are multiple values per category, the variables such as small multiples, cluster column charts, and stacked column charts, shown above, are superior.

2. **The goal is to compare the values of each category.**

3. **The intent is to make it simple for the viewer.** Column charts are arguably sometimes the best of all visualizations, as they tap into our instinctive ability to understand heights, whereas most other data visualizations require some degree of training for the reader to decode.

**Limitations and alternatives**

Column charts are a relatively poor choice when:
1. There are a very large number of categories. With more than about ten data points, other visualizations such as dot charts or even bubble clouds, donut charts, pie charts, and word clouds, are often better.
2. It is interesting to look at the cumulative values of the categories. In such situations pie charts, donut charts, and waterfall charts tend to be superior.
3. The values being represented are small counts (numbers less than 10), in which case pictograph column charts and minimal column charts are often clearer and more interesting.
4. The intended audience has a low level of interest. In this case, the variants of pictographs can be more visually engaging.
5. The values being represented are rates (e.g., deaths per thousand), in which case pictograph area and waffle charts are better.
